### Overview
This is a sample application to serve as a base for deploying a SpringBoot app to Digital Ocean's 'App Platform'. This application
responds to basic HTTP(s) GET requests to `/greeting` with a random greeting.

A custom domain is not created automatically, but can easily be configured after. 

To understand the full configuration, please refer to the Digital Ocean [App Spec Reference](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/app-spec/).
